## Project Overview

As awareness about environmental issues increases, it's imperative for companies to understand, monitor, and reduce their carbon footprints. Traditional methods of assessing emissions often rely on estimates or coarse-grained models. GreenGlimpse changes that.

## Objective

Our main goal is to provide real-time, granular insights into a company's emissions, from the grassroots level of raw material sourcing to the top-tier processes like product delivery and marketing.

## Scope

The GreenGlimpse tool covers the entire gamut of company operations:

- **Raw Material Sourcing**: Understanding the origins and emissions cost of raw materials.
- **Manufacturing & Production**: Real-time tracking of emissions at the factory level.
- **Employee Transportation**: Calculating the carbon footprint of daily commutes and business travels.
- **Product Transportation**: From factory to retail and final consumer.
- **Digital Operations**: Monitoring emissions from cloud storage, servers, and digital marketing campaigns.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Tremor.
- **Back-End**: Node.js, NextAuth, PlanetScale(SQL), Solace PubSub+.
- **IoT**: For on-ground, real-time data collection.
- **5G**: Ensuring that data from IoT devices is transmitted quickly and seamlessly.
- **AI**: Analyzing the vast data sets to provide actionable insights and suggestions for emission reduction.

## Methodology

Our approach involves:

1. **Integration with IoT Devices**: Placing IoT sensors at key points in the operations chain.
2. **Data Collection**: Gathering vast amounts of data in real time.
3. **AI-Powered Analysis**: The AI algorithms dissect this data to highlight emission hotspots and suggest reduction strategies.
4. **Visual Dashboard**: Displaying the data in a user-friendly manner for companies and the public to see.

## Benefits

- **Transparency**: Showcase real and unfiltered emissions data.
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Provide companies with the data needed to make informed decisions.
- **Public Awareness**: Educate the general public about the environmental impacts of products they use.

## Future Enhancements

We envision expanding the capabilities of GreenGlimpse to cover more industries, integrate with other environmental datasets, and offer predictive analytics on future emission trends.
